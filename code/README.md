# Develop and improve a solution

Here are some key points on what you have to do to achieve the project.

_NB: the list below is not exhaustive :)_

You have to be able to:
- parse the input file
- assign rides to vehicles
- calculate the score for each ride
- generate a _valid_ output file
- use the [benchmarking](../bench/README.md) to evaluate the quality of your solutions


## Delivery process

5 input files are located in the `<directory>` directory.
For each input file named `inputX.in`, you must produce **exactly one** output file named `outputX.out`.

For each delivery, a script will take your output files for all inputs and check:
- the formatting of your output files
- the correctness of your score

The results of the delivery will be displayed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
For each output, the result for each file is given as follow:

- `<nb_input> ok <score>`: the output file for input `nb_input` is well-formatted and the calculated score, `score`, is correct.
- `<nb_input> nok 1`: the output file for input `nb_input` is well-formatted but the calculated score is incorrect.
- `<nb_input> nok 2`: the output file for input `nb_input` is not well-formatted.

## Roadmap of deliveries

In order to help you to measure your progression during the week, here is an example of _"ideal"_ progression:

- Monday: TODO
- Tuesday: TODO
- Wednesday: TODO
- Thursday: TODO
- Friday: TODO
- Saturday: TODO
